# Hangman Game ðŸŽ‰

This was a super fun project â€” more practice working with **classes**, **file handling**, and **serialization**

The game includes:

- Word guessing logic ðŸ§   
- Tracking correct and wrong letters  
- Saving & loading game state with YAML
- Basic I/O interaction using text files
